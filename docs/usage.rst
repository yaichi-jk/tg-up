Set recipient or sender
=======================
By default when using *tg-up* without specifying the recipient or sender, *tg-up* will use your
personal chat. This is especially useful because you can use it to upload files from tg-up and then forward
them from your personal chat to as many groups as you like. However you can define the destination. For file upload the
argument is ``--to <entity>``:

.. code-block::

    ~ $ tg-up --to <entity> <file 1>[ <file 2>]

You can *download files* from a specific chat using the ``--from <entity>`` parameter:

.. code-block::

    ~ $ tg-dw --from <entity>

The entity can be defined in multiple ways:

* **Username or groupname**: use the public username or groupname. For example: *john*.
* **Public link**: the public user or group link. For example: *https://telegram.dog/john*.
* **Private link**: the private group link. For example: *telegram.me/joinchat/AAAAAEkk2WdoDrB4-Q8-gg*.
* **Telephone**: the user telephone. For example: *+34600000000*.
* **Telegram id**: the user or group telegram id. Use a bot like *@getidsbot* for get the id. For example: *-987654321*
  or *123456789*.

Interactive mode
================
Use the ``-i`` (or ``--interactive``) option to activate the **interactive mode** to choose the dialog (chat,
channel...) and the files. To **upload files** using interactive mode:

    $ tg-up -i

To **download files** using interactive mode:

    $ tg-dw -i

The following keys are available in this mode:

* **Up arrow**: previous option in the list.
* **Down arrow**: next option in the list.
* **Spacebar**: select the current option. The selected option is marked with an asterisk.
* **mouse click**: also to select the option. Some terminals may not support it.
* **Enter**: go to the next wizard step.
* **pageup**: go to the previous page of items. Allows quick navigation..
* **pagedown**: go to the next page of items. Allows quick navigation..

Interactive upload

Interactive download

This wizard has two steps. The *first step* chooses the conversation::

    Select the dialog of the files to download:
    [SPACE] Select dialog [ENTER] Next step
    ( ) Groupchat 1
    ( ) Bob's chat
    ( ) A channel
    ( ) Me

    [ ] image myphoto1.png by My Username @username 2022-01-31 02:15:03+00:00


Proxies
=======
You can use **mtproto proxies** without additional dependencies or **socks4**, **socks5** or **http** proxies
installing ``pysocks``. To install it::

    $ pip install pysocks

To define the proxy you can use the ``--proxy`` parameter::

    $ tg-up image.jpg --proxy mtproxy://secret@proxy.my.site:443

Or you can define one of these variables: ``TG_UP_PROXY``, ``HTTPS_PROXY`` or ``HTTP_PROXY``. To define the
environment variable from terminal::

    $ export HTTPS_PROXY=socks5://user:pass@proxy.my.site:1080
    $ tg-up image.jpg


Parameter ``--proxy`` has higher priority over environment variables. The environment variable
``TG_UP_PROXY`` takes precedence over ``HTTPS_PROXY`` and it takes precedence over ``HTTP_PROXY``. To disable
the OS proxy::

    $ export TG_UP_PROXY=
    $ tg-up image.jpg

The syntax for **mproto proxy** is::

    mtproxy://<secret>@<address>:<port>

For example::

    mtproxy://secret@proxy.my.site:443

The syntax for **socks4**, **socks5** and **http** proxy is::

    <protocol>://[<username>:<password>@]<address>:<port>

An example without credentials::

    http://1.2.3.4:80

An example with credentials::

    socks4://user:pass@proxy.my.site:1080

Caption message
===============
You can add a caption message to the file to upload using the ``--caption`` parameter::

    $ tg-up image.jpg --caption "This is a caption"

This parameter support variables using the ``{}`` syntax. For example::

    $ tg-up image.jpg --caption "This is a caption for {file.stem.capitalize}"

The ``{file}`` variable is the file path. The ``{file.stem}`` variable is the file name without extension. The
``{file.stem.capitalize}`` variable is the file name without extension with the first letter in uppercase. The
``{file}`` variable has attributes for get info about the file like their size, their creation date, their checksums
(md5, sha1, sha256...), their media info (width, height, artist...) and more. For example::

    $ tg-up image.jpg --caption "{file.media.width}x{file.media.height}px {file.media.duration.for_humans}"

If you want to use the ``{}`` syntax in the caption message, you can escape it using the brace twice. For example::

    $ tg-up image.jpg --caption "This is a caption with {{}}"

For get more info about the variables, see the :ref:`caption_format` section.

Split files
===========
By default, when trying to **upload** a file larger than the supported size by Telegram, an error will occur. However,
*tg-up* has different policies for large files using the ``--large-files`` parameter:

* ``fail`` (default): The execution of tg-up is stopped and the uploads are not continued.
* ``split``: The files are split as parts. For example *myfile.tar.00*, *myfile.tar.01*...

The syntax is:

.. code-block::

    ~$ tg-up --large-files <fail|split>

To join the split files using the *split* option, you can use in GNU/Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat myfile.tar.* > myfile.tar

In windows there are different programs like `7z <https://7-zip.org/>`_ or `GSplit <https://www.gdgsoft.com/gsplit>`_.

*tg-up* when downloading split files by default will download the files without joining them. However, the
**download** policy can be changed using the ``--split-files`` parameter:

* ``keep`` (default): Files are downloaded without joining.
* ``join``: Downloaded files are merged after downloading. In case of errors, such as missing files, the keep policy
  is used.

The syntax is:

.. code-block::

    $ tg-dw --split-files <keep|join>
